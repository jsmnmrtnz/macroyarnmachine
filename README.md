Hey!
How exciting you want to build the Macro Yarn Machine. I have built this machine as part of my Master’s project in 2024, and I would have never been able to build it without relying on published Open-Source Hardware projects and the community.

Therefor I want to credit:
1.) Circular Knitic by Varvara Guljajeva and Canet Sola, 2014. https://github.com/var-mar/circular_knitic

2.) HILO Spinning Machine. As I have been working with Sara Diaz Rodriguez closely for the past 2 years and learned about Open Textile Hardware from her. https://www.hilotextiles.com/

If you want to credit my machine, please use:
„Macro Yarn Machine“ by Jasmin Martinez, 2024

further information:
Master Thesis: Martinez, Jasmin. Hacking Textile Tools. 2024. Kunsthochschule Weißensee (Weissensee Art Academy).
Mentored by Prof. Christiane Sauer and Prof. Dr. Lucy Norris.

Note: I reverse-documented building the machine, which should explain why the parts are full of soil and grease. Please excuse this and let me know if it makes anything unclear to you. Now – let’s start building!
